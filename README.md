# Hi there, I'm Thomas 👋

I'm a developer passionate about building tools that bridge the gap between technology and the outdoors. I work across the full stack—from polished frontend experiences (React, React Native) to systems-level work (geospatial libraries, ...). I enjoy solving problems that require both precision and performance.

### 🏔️ What I'm building
- 🔨 **[Ultra Buddy](https://github.com/totorototo/ultra-buddy)**: PWA for trail runners to track progress and elevation.
- 🔨 **[Terminus](https://github.com/totorototo/terminus)**: High-performance GPS route analysis and 3D visualization tool.
- ✅ **[Positic](https://github.com/totorototo/positic)**: Geo-positioning helper libraries in TypeScript and Rust.
- ✅ **[Lybitos-Strava](https://github.com/totorototo/strava)**: React Native mobile app for Strava enthusiasts.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Zig, Rust, OCaml (ReasonML)
- **Frameworks:** React, React Native, Apollo, Rust-Wasm
- **Interests:** Full-stack Development, Frontend Architecture, Systems Programming, Geospatial Data, Sports Tech, Functional Programming

### 🌱 Currently exploring
- Low-level systems in Rust and Zig
- WASM for geospatial performance
